# CO2-emission-by-each-country
Created a dashboard with map chart showing amount of CO₂ emitted in each country. This data is represented through colors : RED for high amount of CO₂ and GREEN for lowest amount of CO₂ 
I also added details like total population, total energy use and the total gdp of each country in the visualization.
The steps that I took to create this representation are as follows:-
1️⃣ Firstly, I downloaded few datasets and uploaded them on Tableau.
2️⃣ Secondly, I joined the datasets using #INNER_JOIN clause.
3️⃣ Then, I adjusted the data types of some dataset columns for an effective visualization.
4️⃣ After everything is set, I depicted the information in the worksheet to view the data by dragging the columns to the centre area of the screen.
5️⃣ Lastly, I added filters to the year and also added some information like total population, total gdp rate and total energy use with the emission of CO² by each country.
